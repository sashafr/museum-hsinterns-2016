# Goals

Based on our meetings with tablet room staff and general background research, we have identified the following goals for our project:

* Explain what cuneiform is
* Provide historical background for the development and use of cuneiform writing
* Introduce people to the everyday lives of people living in ancient Mesopotamia
* Showcase the tablets and their stories

# Audience

We have also identified the following personas to describe future users of our site:

* A high school student in World History who learned briefly about cuneiform tablets in class and wants to learn more. This person should be able to see a variety of different kind of tablets to demonstrate that tablets were not used for a single purpose, but for many.
* A reader of the [Philadelphia Inquirer article](http://www.philly.com/philly/health/at-penn-ancient-tablet-shows-this-summers-eclipse-mania-is-nothing-new-20170609.html) who is intrigued by the tablet mentioned in the article and wants to learn more about ancient scientific writing.
* A middle school or high school teacher who wants to see an array of tablets so that they can build a class project around them.
